# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, written in **MDX** which allows me to use React components directly in my markdown content.

## Why MDX?

MDX is powerful because it combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX components. Here's an example of an interactive React component:

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development** - Tips, tricks, and tutorials
- **Design** - UI/UX thoughts and case studies
- **Personal** - Life updates and reflections

## Code Examples

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for more content. I'm excited to share my journey with you!
